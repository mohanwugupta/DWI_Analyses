These scripts are for preprocessing your two-shelled DWI MRI data, DTI, NODDI (AMICO), and ABTIN modelling. It assumes your data is in BIDS format. Some of the scripts could be a little more clear and efficient in the BIDS formatting when moving files around but I had to change these scripts from their originals to be compliant with BIDS and stopped once they passed the BIDS validator.
